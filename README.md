# Not All Programming Tasks Are Made Equal: Routing LLMs for Code Generation

F24 Human-in-the-loop Machine Learning with Prof. Eric Nalisnick

Code structure:
- `generate.py`: sampling task solutions
- `sandbox.py`: generally unsafe code to execute generated code against test cases
- `router.py`: router training and inference
- `llmr.ipynb`: bulk of experimental analysis, figure creation, evaluation
